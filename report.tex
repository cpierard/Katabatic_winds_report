\section*{Abstract}
    [Must modify this abstract] The study of katabatic winds is relevant because it influences the weather and pollution condition of the valleys in mountainous regions. We propose a field case study of the katabatic winds in the Belledonne Massif, with the objective of measuring the turbulence of the downslope jet and characterise it. We present the basic concepts necessary to study the katabatic winds and the objectives for the proposed project based on previous studies done by students that worked on it before. In the end, a work plan or schedule is presented which describes the activities to do during the next months.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Jean-Emmanuel Sicart for his support and supervision during the research project and for not having a problem to switch from French to Spanish or to English to explain a concept. Also, I would like to thank Claudine Charrondi\`ere for her assistance with EddyPro and all the information regarding the field campaign and the instruments.

I would like to thank all my classmates and friends for their support and for the good times that we had during this year. As well, to all the teachers that help me build the knowledge to be able to arrive at this stage. Special thanks to my friend Angel who helped me plot the topographic map. I want to thank my family that have supported me throughout all these years.

Finally, this master's project would have been impossible without the support of the Make Our Planet Great Again Scholarship, awarded by the French Government.
