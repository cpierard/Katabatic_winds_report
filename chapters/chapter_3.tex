\subsection{Observational site}

The field campaign occurred in the west face of the Grand Colon mountain (2394~meters) in the Belledonne Massif, 15~km East of Grenoble. A topographic map of the area is shown in figure~\ref{fig:obs_site}, where the measuring site is marked with a green star. The west face of the mountain was selected because it gives direct exposure to solar radiation during the afternoon. This is ideal for katabatic winds to form because the ground cools down after the sun goes down.

The meteorological station with the instruments was located at 1770~m height, located in an alpine pasture area (low vegetation and sparse rocks or pebbles) above the forest area and
has a relatively homogeneous slope, which fulfils the essential characteristics for a detailed analysis of the physical process~\citep{blein2016observation}. In particular, the ground was covered by a layer of snow which thickness decreased during the field campaign. The average slope of the site is 30~$\degree$ and it can be seen in the zoomed map in figure~\ref{fig:obs_site_zoom}.

\subsection{Instrumentation} \label{instrumentation}

The instruments placed in the filed where mounted into two masts. The principal mast measured 10.10~m and on it were mounted 11 sonic anemometer and 10 thermocouples (see figure~\ref{fig:mast}). There was a smaller mast with a meteorological station placed a few meters apart from the main mast. It measured temperature, humidity and incident and reflect radiation. In the big mast, there were four types of anemometers with different characteristics and only one type of thermocouple.

The anemometers used were the CSAT3 and CSAT3B~\footnote{The CSAT3B is the most recent version of the CSAT3 but share the same aspect generally.} 3-D sonic anemometers manufactured by Campbells Scientific, which measure three components of the wind with a frequency of 20~Hz. In total there were five CSAT3 and only one CSAT3B. Also, we used four Windsonic 2-D sonic anemometers manufactured by Gill Instruments. This anemometer measures two components of the wind that are aligned to the "plane" of the instrument. At the top of the mast, a Windmater Pro Sonic Anemometer (from Gill Instruments) was placed. As the CSAT3, it measured three components of the wind with a frequency of 20~Hz. In the table~\ref{tab:intruments_anemometers} is possible to see the initial heights at which the anemometers were placed with respect to the ground.

An important aspect of the anemometers is its orientation and alignment with respect to the slope. In this case, we aligned all the anemometers in a manner that the horizontal wind components of the instruments were parallel to the slope surface and the vertical wind component perpendicular to the surface (you can see how the instruments are tilted, following the slope of the mountain, in the figure~\ref{}). The orientation of the instruments was different for the CSAT3, the Windsonic 2-D and the Windmaster Pro. The CSAT3 and CSAT3B were oriented towards the south (180~$\degree$ North off-set), in a way that the $v$ component of the wind was facing the slope (eastwards) and the $u$ was facing the right side of the slope (southwards). The Windsonic 2-D was oriented towards the West (270~$\degree$ North off-set) in a manner that the negative $u$ component was facing the slope (it was facing the towards the valley or towards the West). And the Windmaster Pro was facing towards the slope or facing East (90~$\degree$ North off-set).

Spread along the mast, there are ten thin film thermocouples, that were used to measure the air temperature with a minimal intrusion at high frequency (20~Hz). The initial heights of these instruments are shown in table~\ref{tab:intruments_thermocouples} and can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:mast} at the left of the mast, opposite to the anemometers.

In the middle, there is a radiometer used to measure the radiant flux. Finally, there is an ultrasonic instrument installed in the station to record the height of the snow cover (snow-covered ground was expected in the measuring site). This is important because the snow decreases the height between the ground and the instruments, which is an important parameter in the calculations.

\subsection{Field campaign}

The field campaign could only take place during certain weather conditions and during winter. For this reason, we couldn't establish a certain date for it. First of all, winter is the season when the occurrence of katabatic winds event is greater because of the cold temperatures in the mountains. Also, the other important factor, as mentioned in section~\ref{sec:katabatic_winds}, is that the presence of mesoscale wind systems can overshadow or inhibit the formation of katabatic winds. For this reason, an ideal weather condition for measuring katabatic winds is during anticyclonic events, in which mesoscale wind systems are weak, the skies are clear and the air is cooler.

During the month of February, between the 10th and the 28th,  Grenoble had anticyclonic weather conditions that were brought by three high-pressure systems that passed over the region during this period of time, these were named: Dorit, Erika and Frauke. This meteorological window allowed us to carry out the field campaign. In total, the instruments took measurements for 17 days.

\subsection{Data processing}

In total around 11.5~GB were obtained during the campaign, only taking into account the anemometers, the thermocouples and the meteorological station. The processing of the data depended on the instrument and its frequency of operation. 

\subsubsection{EddyPro data processing}

For the CSAT3 anemometers and the Windmaster Pro we used EddyPro, which is a software that uses the eddy covariance method to compute atmospheric fluxes of certain trace gases, heat flux and energy~\citep{burba2013eddy}. EddyPro computes the averages of each of the components of the wind and the temperature for a certain period of time which we choose. After this, it computes the fluctuations of the variables and computes the covariance between them. There are multiple choices for software that can do this but EddyPro integrates different functions and methods that improve the quality of the output. 

The raw data of the sonic anemometers is in ASCII format, which EddyPro con read only pointing out what are the columns corresponding to each variable and each instrument. For this also we have to specify the height of the instruments with respect to the ground, the orientation of the instruments with respect to the north, the type of average to compute and the period for computing the average. 

Due to the number of days the instruments were operating and the high frequency of acquisition, it was convenient to use a relatively large period for averaging to try to identify the days when there were good conditions for katabatic winds to form. For this reason, we processed the data doing 30 minutes averages for both the CSAT3 anemometers and the Windmaster Pro. This type of average works as a low-pass filter for the raw high-frequency signal, where all the turbulent fluctuations of the variables are lost. For this reason, is only convenient to use this 30~minutes averaged data to identify potential good periods with the required conditions and not to analyse the turbulent characteristics of the flow

After identifying three potentially good nights for katabatic winds episodes, we went back to EddyPro and processed the data using a 5~minutes average period, which works better to analyse the turbulent characteristics of the flow and the respective fluxes.
